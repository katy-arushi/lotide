### Week 1 Functions:
___________
[assertEqual.js](/assertEqual.js)

* A function which accepts two primitive data types as arguments: actual outcome and expected result. The function then prints to console whether the outcome matches the expected result with an assertion statement

[head.js](/head.js)

* a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the head of the array

[tail.js](tail.js)

* a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the tail of the array

[eqArrays.js](/eqArrays.js)

* a function which compares two arrays to determine if they are similar in elements and length

[assertArraysEqual.js](/assertArraysEqual.js)

* a function which utilizes aqArrays.js to compare two arrays for an exact match, then prints to console a pass or fail assertion

[without.js](/without.js)

* a function that accepts two arrays: the source array, and an "itemsToRemove" array. It returns a new array with the items removed.

[flatten.js](/flatten.js)

* a function that accepts a nested array with one level of nesting as an argument, and returns a single "flattened" array
___________
### Week 2 Functions:
______

[middle.js](/middle.js)

* A function that accepts an array, and returns the middle index value(s) in a new array

[countOnly.js](/countOnly.js)

* a function that accepts an array of names, and an object of names you wish to make a tally of. Returns a new object with a name count

[countLetters.js](/countLetters.js)

* a function that accepts a string of characters. It then returns an object with a tally of characters

[letterPositions.js](/letterPositions.js)

* a function that accepts a string of characters. It then returns an object with an array for each character present

[findByKeyValue.js](/findKeyByValue.js)

* a function an searches for a key on an object where its value matches a given value

[eqObjects.js](/eqObjects.js)

* a function which compares two objects to see if they are similar

[assertObjectsEqual.js](/assertObjectsEqual.js)

* a function which takes two parameters, the actual object, and the expected object, and returns an assertion passed or failed

[map.js](/map.js)

* this is a copy of the higher order map() method. map() creates a new array populated with results of a callback function on every element in a specified array

takeUntil.js

* the function takeUntil() will collect items from a provided array until the callback function provided returns a truthy value
